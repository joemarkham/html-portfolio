<h1>Joe's Super Awesome Top 3 Movies</h1>
<h2>The Only List That Matters</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio led film directed by Martin Scorsese. 
    Amazing psychological thriller with a classic Scorsese twist at the end.</p>
<h3>Idiocracy</h3>
<p>A masterpiece of a film. It was created as a comedy but is becomming a documentary.</p>
<h3>Home Alone 2</h3>
<p>I loved this movie as a child. Now that I have a child, the way she laughs when this movie is on, will always make
    this a top movie for sentimental reasons. </p>
