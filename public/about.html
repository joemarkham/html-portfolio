<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>First of all. Thank you for considering me. I'm a 30 somthing year old looking to change professions
  for the betterment of myself and my family. I'm extremely hard working and loyal to a fault (hench why I'm 
  starting over in my 30s). My background is in business with a heavy emphasis in quality and customer relations. 
</p>

<p>Taking the leap of faith into this profession wasn't easy after spending most of my adult life managing a chain of
  fast casual resturant for a private group that treated me like family. My hope is that I can find a home where I can
grow my skills and provide some quality work.</p>
